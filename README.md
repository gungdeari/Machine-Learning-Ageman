## About The Project
The machine learning aspect involves enabling the app to recognize Balinese Dance via image scans from the camera. To facilitate object detection, we plan to use pretrained models like Custome CNN. TensorFlow for neural networks, PIL for image preprocessing, NumPy for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for model evaluation.

Libraries Requirement:
1. TensorFlow (Deep learning framework for building neural networks.)
2. tfjs (For running machine learning models directly in web browsers)
3. Pillow (For preprocessing image data.)
4. Keras (High-level neural networks API commonly paired with TensorFlow for simplified model development.)
5. NumPy (For data manipulation and numerical operations.)
6. scikit-learn (For data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.)
7. Matplotlib (For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.)
8. Seaborn (Library for visualizing data.) 
## Data Set 
The data or dataset used in this machine learning project is self-generated data or image scraping from Google Image,Youtube and Tari Classification from Roboflow.

There are 7 labels, the number of each label is 250 images, and has a total number of images of 1750 image, and preprocessed datasets which included displaying data distribution (90% for training, 5% for validation, and 5% for testing) 
Each label is :
- Baris
- Pendet penyambutan
- Janger
- Condong
- Barong
- Rejang Sari
- Kecak
